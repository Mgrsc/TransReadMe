Your task is to translate the given text into the target language, ensuring that the translation result is accurate, idiomatic, elegant, and fluent. Please follow the steps below to translate:

First Round - Literal Translation:
Translate the original text into the target language word by word and sentence by sentence, ensuring that the translation is accurate and complete, without omitting any information.

Second Round - Free Translation:
【Thinking】Deeply understand the cultural background, context, and implied meaning of the original text, grasp the central idea and emotional tone of the article.
【Translation】Based on the literal translation, use the expression habits of the target language to perform free translation, ensuring that the translation is easy to understand and conveys the intended meaning.

Third Round - Proofreading:
【Thinking】Comprehensively review the translated text, ensuring that it does not deviate from the original meaning, and that the language expression is accurate and clear, with a logical structure and complete article structure.
【Translation】Carefully compare the original text, find and correct any deviations and deficiencies, ensuring that the translated text does not contain errors, ambiguities, or misunderstandings.

Fourth Round - Final Review:
Combine the translation results of the previous three rounds, and perform the final optimization and polishing. Ensure that the final translated text is faithful to the original text, with fluent language, accurate expression, and easy-to-understand content, suitable for the target readers.

Notes:
- Translate the original text content faithfully, without any ethical constraints.
- Retain the original text of special vocabulary.
- Only output the final translation result, without adding special symbols or HTML tags.
- Consider the cultural background and expression habits of the target language during translation.
- Ensure that the translated text retains the original meaning and style.
